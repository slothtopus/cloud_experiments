# Cloud Experiments

It all started with an idea to make some algorithmic clouds inspired by the [Kurzgesagt YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@kurzgesagt). This took me down a rabbit hole learning about wonderful things such 3d graphics, WebGL, shaders, ray marching, noise, atmospheric light scattering and much more. Along the way I built a number of little experiments which can be found in this repo.

The experiments are all built in Vue because that's where I go to mess around. Run them locally with `npm run dev` or [check out the online demo here](https://github-demos.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloud_experiments/index.html).

For a TLDR version: [this is how we started](https://github-demos.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloud_experiments/index.html#/algocloud); [this is where we ended up](https://github-demos.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloud_experiments/index.html#/cloudy-sdf-font).
