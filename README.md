# Cloud Experiments

It all started with an idea to make some algorithmic clouds inspired by the [Kurzgesagt YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@kurzgesagt). This took me down a rabbit hole learning about wonderful things 3d graphics, WebGL, shaders, ray marching, noise, atmospheric light scattering and many other things. Along the way I built a number of little experiments.

These are all built in Vue because it's where I go to mess around. Run them locally with `npm run dev` or [check out the online demo here](https://github-demos.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloud_experiments/index.html).

For a TLDR version. [This is how we started](https://github-demos.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloud_experiments/index.html#/algocloud). [This is where we ended up](https://github-demos.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloud_experiments/index.html#/cloudy-sdf-font).
